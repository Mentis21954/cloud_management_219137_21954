It operates several international editions, including one in the United Kingdom.\nInsider publishes original reporting and aggregates material from other outlets. As of 2011, it maintained a liberal policy on the use of anonymous sources. It has also published native advertising and granted sponsors editorial control of its content. The outlet has been nominated for several awards, but is criticized for using factually incorrect clickbait headlines to attract viewership.\nIn 2015, Axel Springer SE acquired 88 percent of the stake in Insider Inc. for $343 million (\u20ac306 million), implying a total valuation of $442 million.","CNN":"CNN (Cable News Network) is a multinational  cable news channel headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.  Founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel, and presently owned by the Manhattan-based media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and the first all-news television channel in the United States.As of September 2018, CNN had 90.1 million television households as subscribers (97.7% of households with cable). According to Nielsen, in June 2021 CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021.Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories; since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, some islands of the Caribbean and in Japan, where it was first broadcast on CNNj in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Cable News Network launched at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw.Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to several cable and satellite television providers, websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (11 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world.","Engadget":"Engadget ( in-GAJ-it) is a multilingual technology blog network with daily coverage of gadgets and consumer electronics. Engadget manages ten blogs, four of which are written in English and six have international versions with independent editorial staff. It has been operated by Yahoo since September 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\nEngadget was founded by former Gizmodo technology weblog editor and co-founder Peter Rojas. Engadget was the largest blog in Weblogs, Inc., a blog network with over 75 weblogs, including Autoblog and Joystiq, which formerly included Hackaday. Weblogs Inc. was purchased by AOL in 2005.Launched in March 2004, Engadget is updated multiple times a day with articles on gadgets and consumer electronics. It also posts rumors about the technological world, frequently offers opinion within its stories, and produces the weekly Engadget Podcast that covers tech and gadget news stories that happened during the week.On December 30, 2009, Engadget released its first mobile app for the iPhone and iPod Touch.Overnight, on July 15, 2013, Tim Stevens stepped down as the editor-in-chief, placing gdgts' Marc Perton as the interim executive editor.  In November 2013, a major redesign was launched that merged gdgts' features into Engadget, such as the database of devices and aggregated reviews. The changes aimed to turn Engadget into a more extensive consumer electronics resource, similarly to CNET and Consumer Reports, aimed towards \"the early adopter in all of us\".As of April 2014, Michael Gorman was the editor-in-chief, alongside Christopher Trout as executive editor.On December 2, 2015, Engadget introduced another redesign, as well as a new editorial direction with a focus on broader topics influenced by technology; Gorman explained that \"the core Engadget audience\u2014people who are very much involved in the industry\u2014pay attention to it closely, but the new editorial direction is really meant to make it approachable for folks outside of that realm.\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== William Shatner and Twitter verification ===\nOn June 21, 2014, actor William Shatner raised an issue with several Engadget editorial staff and their \"verification\" status on Twitter.","Hackaday":"Hackaday is a hardware hacking website.  It was founded in 2004 as a web magazine. Since 2014, Hackaday also hosts a community database of open-source hardware designs.\n\n\n== History ==\nHackaday was founded in 2004 by Phillip Torrone as a web magazine for Engadget, devoted to publishing and archiving \"the best hacks, mods and DIY projects from around web\". Hackaday was since split from Engadget and its former parent company Weblogs, Inc. by its at the time owner Jason Calacanis. In 2007 Computerworld magazine ranked Hackaday #10 on their list of the top 15 geek blog sites.Hackaday.io started as a project hosting site in 2014 under the name of Hackaday Projects. It allows users to upload open-source hardware designs. As of 2015, it had grown into a social network of 100,000 members.In 2015, Hackaday's owner, Supplyframe, acquired the hardware marketplace Tindie.In 2021, Hackaday's owner, Supplyframe, was acquired by Siemens.","Reuters":"Reuters ( (listen), ROY-terz) is a news agency owned by Thomson Reuters Corporation. It employs around 2,500 journalists and 600 photojournalists in about 200 locations worldwide. Reuters is one of the largest news agencies in the world.The agency was established in London in 1851 by the German-born Paul Reuter. It was acquired by the Thomson Corporation of Canada in 2008 and now makes up the media division of Thomson Reuters.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nPaul Reuter worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to Reuter, who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on, in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen, in what today is Aachen's Reuters House.\nReuter moved to London in 1851 and established a news wire agency at the London Royal Exchange. Headquartered in London, Reuter's company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance.\" It was the first to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in Europe, for instance, in 1865.In 1865, Reuter incorporated his private business, under the name Reuter's Telegram Company Limited; Reuter was appointed managing director of the company.In 1870 the press agencies French Havas (founded in 1835), British Reuter's (founded in 1851) and German Wolff (founded in 1849) signed an agreement (known as the Ring Combination) that set 'reserved territories' for the three agencies.","The Guardian":"The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, and changed its name in 1959. Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust. The trust was created in 1936 to \"secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference\". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. Since 2018, the paper's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format. As of July 2021, its print edition had a daily circulation of 105,134. The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) and Guardian US (founded in 2011).","The Verge":"The Verge is an American technology news website operated by Vox Media, publishing news, feature stories, guidebooks, product reviews, consumer electronics news, and podcasts.The website launched on November 1, 2011, and uses Vox Media's proprietary multimedia publishing platform Chorus.

The Verge won five Webby Awards for the year 2012 including awards for Best Writing (Editorial), Best Podcast for The Vergecast, Best Visual Design, Best Consumer Electronics Site, and Best Mobile News App.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nBetween March and April 2011, up to nine of Engadget's writers, editors, and product developers, including editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky, left AOL, the company behind that website, to start a new gadget site. The other departing editors included managing editor Nilay Patel and staffers Paul Miller, Ross Miller, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, as well as product developers Justin Glow, and Dan Chilton. In early April 2011, Topolsky announced that their unnamed new site would be produced in partnership with sports news website SB Nation, debuting some time in the fall. Topolsky lauded SB Nation's similar interest in the future of publishing, including what he described as their beliefs in independent journalism and in-house development of their own content delivery tools. Jim Bankoff of SB Nation saw an overlap in the two sites' demographics and an opportunity to expand SB Nation's model. Bankoff previously worked at AOL in 2005, where he led their Engadget acquisition. Other news outlets viewed the partnership as positive for both SB Nation and Topolsky's staff, and negative for AOL's outlook.Bankoff, chairman and CEO of Vox Media (owner of SB Nation), said in a 2011 interview that though the company had started out with a focus on sports, other categories including consumer technology had growth potential for the company.","Wired":"Wired may refer to:\n\n\n== Arts, entertainment, and media ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nWired (Jeff Beck album), 1976\nWired (Hugh Cornwell album), 1993\nWired (Mallory Knox album), 2017\n\"Wired\", a song by Prism from their album Beat Street\n\"Wired\", a song by Sevendust from their eponymous debut album\n\n\n=== Television ===\nWired (TV series), a 2008 British television miniseries\nWired, 1988 TV series produced by  Tim Graham\n\"Wired\", a 2005 two-part episode of Power Rangers: SPD\n\"Wired\", a 2002 two-part episode of  The Zeta Project animated series\n\n\n=== Other uses in arts, entertainment, and media ===\nWired (book), a 1984 book by Bob Woodward about the American actor and comedian John Belushi\nWired (film), a 1989 adaptation of the book by Bob Woodward\nWired (novel), a 2005 science fiction novel by Douglas E.

The Verge won five Webby Awards for the year 2012 including awards for Best Writing (Editorial), Best Podcast for The Vergecast, Best Visual Design, Best Consumer Electronics Site, and Best Mobile News App.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nBetween March and April 2011, up to nine of Engadget's writers, editors, and product developers, including editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky, left AOL, the company behind that website, to start a new gadget site. The other departing editors included managing editor Nilay Patel and staffers Paul Miller, Ross Miller, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, as well as product developers Justin Glow, and Dan Chilton. In early April 2011, Topolsky announced that their unnamed new site would be produced in partnership with sports news website SB Nation, debuting some time in the fall. Topolsky lauded SB Nation's similar interest in the future of publishing, including what he described as their beliefs in independent journalism and in-house development of their own content delivery tools. Jim Bankoff of SB Nation saw an overlap in the two sites' demographics and an opportunity to expand SB Nation's model. Bankoff previously worked at AOL in 2005, where he led their Engadget acquisition. Other news outlets viewed the partnership as positive for both SB Nation and Topolsky's staff, and negative for AOL's outlook.Bankoff, chairman and CEO of Vox Media (owner of SB Nation), said in a 2011 interview that though the company had started out with a focus on sports, other categories including consumer technology had growth potential for the company.","VentureBeat":"VentureBeat is an American technology website headquartered in San Francisco, California.

While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021.Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories; since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs.

It employs around 2,500 journalists and 600 photojournalists in about 200 locations worldwide. Reuters is one of the largest news agencies in the world.The agency was established in London in 1851 by the German-born Paul Reuter. It was acquired by the Thomson Corporation of Canada in 2008 and now makes up the media division of Thomson Reuters.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nPaul Reuter worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to Reuter, who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on, in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen, in what today is Aachen's Reuters House.\nReuter moved to London in 1851 and established a news wire agency at the London Royal Exchange. Headquartered in London, Reuter's company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance.\" It was the first to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in Europe, for instance, in 1865.In 1865, Reuter incorporated his private business, under the name Reuter's Telegram Company Limited; Reuter was appointed managing director of the company.In 1870 the press agencies French Havas (founded in 1835), British Reuter's (founded in 1851) and German Wolff (founded in 1849) signed an agreement (known as the Ring Combination) that set 'reserved territories' for the three agencies.","The Verge":"The Verge is an American technology news website operated by Vox Media, publishing news, feature stories, guidebooks, product reviews, consumer electronics news, and podcasts.The website launched on November 1, 2011, and uses Vox Media's proprietary multimedia publishing platform Chorus.

The other departing editors included managing editor Nilay Patel and staffers Paul Miller, Ross Miller, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, as well as product developers Justin Glow, and Dan Chilton. In early April 2011, Topolsky announced that their unnamed new site would be produced in partnership with sports news website SB Nation, debuting some time in the fall. Topolsky lauded SB Nation's similar interest in the future of publishing, including what he described as their beliefs in independent journalism and in-house development of their own content delivery tools. Jim Bankoff of SB Nation saw an overlap in the two sites' demographics and an opportunity to expand SB Nation's model. Bankoff previously worked at AOL in 2005, where he led their Engadget acquisition. Other news outlets viewed the partnership as positive for both SB Nation and Topolsky's staff, and negative for AOL's outlook.Bankoff, chairman and CEO of Vox Media (owner of SB Nation), said in a 2011 interview that though the company had started out with a focus on sports, other categories including consumer technology had growth potential for the company.","Wired":"Wired may refer to:\n\n\n== Arts, entertainment, and media ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nWired (Jeff Beck album), 1976\nWired (Hugh Cornwell album), 1993\nWired (Mallory Knox album), 2017\n\"Wired\", a song by Prism from their album Beat Street\n\"Wired\", a song by Sevendust from their eponymous debut album\n\n\n=== Television ===\nWired (TV series), a 2008 British television miniseries\nWired, 1988 TV series produced by  Tim Graham\n\"Wired\", a 2005 two-part episode of Power Rangers: SPD\n\"Wired\", a 2002 two-part episode of  The Zeta Project animated series\n\n\n=== Other uses in arts, entertainment, and media ===\nWired (book), a 1984 book by Bob Woodward about the American actor and comedian John Belushi\nWired (film), a 1989 adaptation of the book by Bob Woodward\nWired (novel), a 2005 science fiction novel by Douglas E.

Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast ABC World News Tonight with David Muir; other programs include morning news-talk show Good Morning America, Nightline, Primetime, and 20/20, and Sunday morning political affairs program This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\nIn addition to the division's television programs, ABC News has radio and digital outlets, including ABC News Radio and ABC News Live, plus various podcasts hosted by ABC News personalities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nABC began in 1943 as the NBC Blue Network, a radio network that was spun off from NBC, as ordered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1942. The reason for the order was to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the United States, specifically news and political broadcasting, and broaden the projected points of view. The radio market was dominated by only a few companies, such as NBC and CBS. NBC conducted the split voluntarily in case its appeal of the ruling was denied and it was forced to split its two networks into separate companies.\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial owned-and-operated television station (WJZ-TV, now WABC-TV) and production center in New York City in August 1948. Broadcasts continued as the ABC network expanded nationwide. Until the early 1970s, ABC News programs and ABC in general consistently ranked third in viewership behind CBS and NBC news programs. ABC had fewer affiliate stations and a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to support the network's news operations compared to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n\n=== Roone Arledge ===\nBy the 1970s, the network had effectively turned around, with its prime-time entertainment programs achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to ABC overall.","Al Jazeera English":"Al Jazeera English (AJE; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-jaz\u012brah, pronounced [\u00e6l (d)\u0292\u00e6\u02c8zi\u02d0r\u0250], literally \"The Peninsula\", referring to the Qatar Peninsula) is an international 24-hour English-language news channel owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network, which is owned by the monarchy government of Qatar. It is the first English-language news channel to be headquartered in the Middle East. Instead of being run centrally, news management rotates between broadcasting centres in Doha and London.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe channel was launched on 15 November 2006, at 12:00 PM GMT. It had aimed to begin broadcasting in June 2006 but had to postpone its launch because its HDTV technology was not yet ready. The channel was due to be called Al Jazeera International, but the name was changed nine months before the launch because one of the channel's backers argued that the original Arabic-language channel already had an international scope.The channel was anticipated to reach around 40 million households, but it far exceeded that launch target, reaching 80 million homes. By 2009, the service could be viewed in every major European market and was available to 130 million homes in over 100 countries via cable and satellite, according to a spokeswoman for the network in Washington.The channel, however, has poor penetration in the American market, where it has been carried by only one satellite service and a small number of cable networks. Al Jazeera English later began a campaign to enter the North American market, including a dedicated website. It became available to some cable subscribers in New York in August 2011, having previously been available as an option for some viewers in Washington, D.C., Ohio and Los Angeles. The channel primarily reaches the United States via its live online streaming. It is readily available on most major Canadian television providers including Rogers and Bell Satellite TV after the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the channel for distribution in Canada on 26 November 2009.Al Jazeera English and Iran's state-run Press TV were the only international English-language television broadcasters with journalists reporting from inside both Gaza and Israel during the 2008\u20132009 Israel-Gaza conflict.","BBC News":"BBC News is an operational business division of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) responsible for the gathering and broadcasting of news and current affairs in the UK and around the world.

According to Nielsen, in June 2021 CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021.Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories; since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs.

Headquartered in London, Reuter's company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance.\" It was the first to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in Europe, for instance, in 1865.In 1865, Reuter incorporated his private business, under the name Reuter's Telegram Company Limited; Reuter was appointed managing director of the company.In 1870 the press agencies French Havas (founded in 1835), British Reuter's (founded in 1851) and German Wolff (founded in 1849) signed an agreement (known as the Ring Combination) that set 'reserved territories' for the three agencies.","Rock Paper Shotgun":"Rock Paper Shotgun (also rendered Rock, Paper, Shotgun; short RPS) is a UK-based website for reporting on video games, primarily for PC.

As Mint's Director of Marketing, Langille noticed that the infographics posted to MintLife, the company blog, generated 30 times more traffic than a comparable text article. According to Langille, \u201cwe knew we were onto something big.\u201dIn April 2011, Langille, along with MintLife's Editor-in-Chief Lee Sherman and Adam Breckler, a Mint web developer, left Mint.com to co-found Visual.ly with Tal Siach, the founder of Walyou, an Israeli gadget site. Langille states that Visual.ly aims to evolve how digital news media outlets present information, similar to how USA Today\u2019s weather infographics transformed news outlets in the early \u201890s and how Wired\u2019s graphic design influenced digital media in the early 2000s.In October 2011, Visual.ly announced a $2 million round in seed funding, led by Crosslink Capital, 500 Startups, and SoftTech. At the time of the announcement, Visual.ly had 26,000 users, 7,000 infographics, and 1 million monthly page views. They have partnered with The Atlantic, Buzzfeed, AskMen, CNNMoney, and National Geographic, among other media outlets, to provide infographics and data visualizations.\n\n\n== Site structure ==\nVisual.ly is structured as both as a showcase for infographics as well as a marketplace and community for publishers, designers, and researchers. The site allows users to search images through description, tags, and sources in a variety of categories, ranging from Education to Business or Politics."}},"microsoft":{"articles":{"9to5Mac":[{"author":"Filipe Esp\u00f3sito","content":"The watchOS App Store has seen many important third-party apps leave the platform in recent years, and it seems that this is still an ongoing problem.

The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after.

Headquartered in London, Reuter's company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after.
